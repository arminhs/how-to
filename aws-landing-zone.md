# AWS Landing Zone

## Introduction

AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. It provides a pre-configured baseline environment to simplify the initial setup and governance of an AWS environment, allowing you to move quickly to start using AWS services.

The Landing Zone Accelerator is a packaged solution that can be deployed in just a few hours, providing a secure and scalable architecture for your AWS environment. The solution provides a set of scripts, AWS CloudFormation templates, and pre-built AWS accounts, along with a step-by-step deployment guide to help you automate the creation of an AWS Landing Zone. The Accelerator can be used as-is, or can be customized to meet specific requirements.

## Deployment

To deploy the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator, you can follow these steps:

1. Preparation: Ensure that you have the necessary AWS accounts and permissions, including AWS Organizations and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.
2. Download: Download the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator scripts and templates from the AWS Solutions site or GitHub repository.
3. Customize: If necessary, customize the AWS CloudFormation templates and scripts to meet your specific requirements.
4. Deploy: Run the deployment scripts to create your AWS Landing Zone. The scripts use AWS CloudFormation to create the necessary AWS resources, such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, and IAM roles.
5. Validate: Validate the deployment by checking the AWS CloudFormation outputs and by testing the AWS resources created by the scripts.
6. Start using AWS: Once your AWS Landing Zone is deployed and validated, you can start using AWS services and configure your applications to run in the new environment.
It's important to follow the best practices and guidelines provided in the AWS Landing Zone documentation, to ensure the security and reliability of your AWS environment.
